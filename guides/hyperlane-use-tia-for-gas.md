# How to use Hyperlane token (TIA) as gas token in your rollup

This guide builds upon [CosmWasm rollup](../tutorials/cosmwasm.md), where you set up a local rollup devnet with integrated CosmWasm. In this guide, we will be exploring how to integrate Hyperlane as a safer IBC alterntive for token transfers in your rollup.

The smart contract we will use for this tutorial is one provided by
the CosmWasm team for Nameservice purchasing.

You can check out the contract [here](https://github.com/InterWasm/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nameservice).

How to write the Rust smart contract for Nameservice is outside the scope of
this tutorial.
