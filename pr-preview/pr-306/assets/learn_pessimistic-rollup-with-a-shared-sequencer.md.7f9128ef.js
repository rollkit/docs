We assume the only canonical way to order the transactions are through the Shared Sequencer.

These soft commitments provide some arbitrary promise of the final ordering of transactions, and can be used to create prematurely updated versions of the state.

Then the liveness of this scheme is $L = Min[L_{ss},L_{da}]$ saying if one of the Systems has a liveness failure the Rollup has a liveness failure. If the Shared Sequencer fails then we cannot proceed with the Rollup. If the DA-Layer fails we could continue with the Shared Sequencers Soft Commitments. We would inherit the consensuses and data-availability from the Shared Sequencer which would be worse than the original Data-Availability Layer.</p><h2 id="liveness" tabindex="-1">Liveness <a class="header-anchor" href="#liveness" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Liveness&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Based rollups enjoys the same liveness guarantees as the DA-Layer (Based Rollups).</p><h2 id="rollup-light-nodes" tabindex="-1">Rollup Light Nodes <a class="header-anchor" href="#rollup-light-nodes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rollup Light Nodes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>N/A</p><h2 id="smallest-trust-minimized-setup" tabindex="-1">Smallest Trust-Minimized Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#smallest-trust-minimized-setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Smallest Trust-Minimized Setup&quot;">​</a></h2><p>DA-Layer Light Node + Shared Sequencer Light Node + Rollup Full Node</p><p>We need a Shared Sequencer Light Node to validate the Headers of the Shared Sequencer.

The Shared Sequencer will have a cryptographic commitment of the order of the Transaction inside the Shared Sequencer Header. This way we can confirm that the batch that we receive or read from the DA-Layer is the one created by the Shared Sequencer.</p>',15);function m(g,S,f,A,q,_){const r=i("Mermaid");return e(),o("div",null,[u,(e(),n(h,null,{default:a(()=>[l(r,{id:"mermaid-15",graph:"graph%20TB%0A%20%20U%5B%22User%22%5D%20--%3E%20T%5B%22Transaction%22%5D%20--%3E%20SA%5B%22Shared%20Aggregator%22%5D%0A%0A%20%20subgraph%20A%5B%22Aggregator%22%5D%0A%20%20%20%20SA%20--%3E%20OB1%5B%22Ordered%20Batch%22%5D%20--%3E%20DAL%5B%22DA-Layer%22%5D%0A%20%20%20%20SA%20--%3E%20OB2%5B%22Soft%20Committed%20Ordered%20Batch%20%5Cn%20%26%20Shared%20Aggregator%20Header%2B%22%5D%0A%20%20end%0A%20%20%0A%20%20OB2%20--%3E%20FN%5B%22Rollup%20Full%20Node%22%5D%0A%20%20DAL%20--%3E%20OB3%5B%22Ordered%20Batch%22%5D%20--%3E%20FN%0A%0A%20%20style%20U%20stroke%3AcurrentColor%2C%20fill%3A%23FFA07A%0A%20%20style%20SA%20stroke%3AcurrentColor%2C%20fill%3A%2387CEFA%0A%20%20style%20FN%20stroke%3AcurrentColor%2C%20fill%3A%2398FB98%0A%20%20style%20DAL%20stroke%3AcurrentColor%2C%20fill%3A%23D8BFD8%0A"})]),fallback:a(()=>[d(" Loading...
