It implements the sequencing interface functions described above. For example, <a href="https://github.com/rollkit/centralized-sequencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">centralized-sequencer</a> is the refactored functionality from the Rollkit prior to <code>v0.14.0</code>. The centralized sequencer is the middleware run by the aggregator node of the Rollkit rollup. The aggregator node relays rollup transactions to centralized sequencer which then submits them to the DA network (such as Celestia). The header producer node then retrieves (via <code>GetNextBatch</code>) the batched transaction from the centralized sequencer to execute the transactions and produce the updated rollup state. Similarly, there are other sequencing middlewares which can be built for various sequencing strategies or even for connecting to different third-party sequencing networks.</p><p>The sequencing implementations that are currently work in progress:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/rollkit/centralized-sequencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">centralized-sequencer</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rollkit/based-sequencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">based-sequencer</a></li><li><a href="./">forced-inclusion-sequencer</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rollkit/astria-sequencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">astria-sequencer</a></li></ul>`,12)]))}const g=t(r,[["render",s]]);export{p as __pageData,g as default};
