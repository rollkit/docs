Think of it as an organizer that takes all incoming transactions, puts them in a clear order, and then groups them into batches. This process is vital for keeping everything consistent and making the rollup run. Rollkit uses a &quot;Sequencing Interface&quot; with key functions like submitting, retrieving, and verifying these transaction batches, ensuring smooth communication between the rollup and the sequencing mechanism, which often acts as a bridge to the underlying network.</p><h2 id="sequencing-interface" tabindex="-1">Sequencing Interface <a class="header-anchor" href="#sequencing-interface" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sequencing Interface {#sequencing-interface}&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit/blob/main/core/sequencer/sequencing.go#L11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sequencing Interface</a> defines a sequencing interface for communicating between any sequencing network and Rollkit.
